What if voltage wasnâ€™t just energy, but geometry?
# âš¡ SpacetimePotential

**What if voltage wasnâ€™t just a number â€” but a geometric distortion of spacetime itself?**  
This project simulates electric potential fields (voltage) as 2D warped geometries, treating them like mini spacetime wells.  
The gradient of this field becomes a force map â€” a visualization of how charged particles would fall through this electro-spacetime terrain, much like matter falling through a gravitational well.

## ðŸ”­ Features

- Voltage visualized as a curved **2D heightmap** using Gaussian potential wells
- Electric field vectors computed from the gradient of the potential (`-âˆ‡V`)
- Spartan-tier high-res simulation (Einstein-tested, Neo-approved)
- Modular Python code using `NumPy` + `Matplotlib`

## ðŸ”¬ Why This Exists

This project explores a question often ignored in physics classrooms:  
> *Could voltage â€” a form of energy â€” also be thought of as a curvature in space?*

Itâ€™s an artistic and computational meditation on how electricity, geometry, and motion intersect.

## ðŸ“¦ How to Use

Run the simulation in Google Colab or locally via Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
python main_simulation.py

Or open main_simulation.ipynb in Colab for live experimentation.
